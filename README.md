## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require vursion/vursion
```

***No need to register the service provider if you're using Laravel >= 5.5.
The package will automatically register itself.***
Once the package is installed, you can register the service provider in config/app.php in the providers array:
```
'providers' => [
	...
	Vursion\Vursion\VursionServiceProvider::class
],
```

Configure your vursion API key in your `.env` file.
```bash
VURSION_KEY=
```

To publish the config file to `config/vursion.php` run:
```bash
php artisan vursion:publish
```

This is the content of the published config file:

```php
return [

    'key' => env('VURSION_KEY'),

    'enabled' => env('VURSION_ENABLED', true),

];
```

### Don't forget to add the cron job needed to trigger Laravelâ€™s scheduling!
